# LLM-Router ðŸš€

**LLM-Router** is a lightweight Python framework to intelligently route tasks to the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) based on **task type, performance benchmarks, and cost efficiency**. It supports multiple LLM providers including **Gemini, Mistral, OpenAI, and Groq**, allowing seamless task execution across different models while optimizing for **cost, speed, and accuracy**.

---

## Features âœ¨

- **Multi-LLM orchestration**: Automatically selects the best LLM for a given task.
- **Task-based selection**: Supports task types like:
  - `small` (short text, summarization)
  - `medium` (long text, complex text generation)
  - `heavy` (code generation, long context tasks)
  - `image` (image generation prompts)
  - `video` (future support)
- **Cost-effective**: Utilizes free token quotas and ranks models by benchmark-to-cost ratio for startups and price-sensitive companies.
- **Retry and fallback mechanism**: Automatically switches to the next suitable LLM if a model fails.
- **Streaming support**: Stream outputs from LLMs where supported.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new LLM providers with minimal code changes.
